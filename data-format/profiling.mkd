## The Profiling Output Format 

  * Version:    0.8.2
  * Maintainer: Johannes Dr√∂ge <johannes.droege@uni-duesseldorf.de>

###1.The profiling format specification

The taxonomic profiling format was specified for the CAMI competition and is intended
to serve as a standard format for taxonomic profiling methods.

It is a TAB-delimited text format consisting of a header section and an output
section. The header must be prior the output. Header lines start with '@' or
'#' for comments, while output lines do not. 

Each output line has 4 mandatory fields: The TAXID, the RANK, TAXPATH and the
PERCENTAGE. Further optional columns can be appended to the right.

###1.2 The header section

The header section may contain comment lines, which begin with the character
'#'. Each mandatory header line begins with the character '@'. If there is just
one '@', this is followed by a data field with the format 'TAG:VALUE' where TAG
is a variable alphanumeric string that defines the content and the format of
VALUE. Each of these header lines should match:
/^\@[A-Za-z0-9]+\:[A-Za-z0-9\s]+/ or /^\@[A-Za-z0-9\s]+\:[0-9]+\.[0-9]+/.
Though capitalisation can be used for readability, tags are regarded as case
insensitive. 

In this format version just the tag SAMPLEID and VERSION is required.

  * SAMPLEID is a unique identifier for a sequence sample. Do not give a tool
    name or your name here.
  * VERSION This gives information about the profiling format version. You can
    find the current version under the heading.

The last line in the header section begins with '@@' and includes tab-separated
column tags, where TAG is a variable string that defined the conten and format
for the output section. The order of the columns should match:

    TAXID	RANK TAXPATH	PERCENTAGE

This line should also match:

    /^\@\@[A-Za-z]+(\t[A-Za-z]+)+/

For instance:

  @@TAXID	RANK	TAXPATH	PERCENTAGE

  @@TAXID	RANK	TAXPATH	TAXPATH_SN	PERCENTAGE

The last line is always the header for the output section and begins with '@@'.
It defines the content of the output columns in a tab-separated format. The
tags are described in the output section below.

###1.3 The Output section

The TAXID specifies a unique alphanumeric ID for a node in a reference tree
such as the NCBI taxonomy. This will be used for evaluation of your predictions
with taxonomy-based measures. If you resolve to bins below existing taxonomic
IDs in your reference tree, e.g. to resolve novel strains, you can append a
numeric identifier to your classification, e.g. 5232.1(according to the
provided taxonomy version from the download site).

RANK includes alphanumeric identifiers that define ranks in the reference
taxonomy at which the respective taxon is located. The used ranks in the NCBI
taxonomy: superkingdom	phylum	class	order	family	genus	species	strain

The PERCENTAGE field specifies what percentage of the sample was assigned to
the respective TAXID. The PERCENTAGE can be a real number between 0 and 100.
The percentages given for all taxa from the same rank should sum up to <= 100%,
that is, if something is unassigned, this will be reflected in a percentage of
less than 100% being assigned.

The TAXPATH and TAXPATH_SN tag is the path from the root of the reference
taxonomy to the respective taxon, where alphanumeric identifiers such as the
TAXIDs (TAXPATH) or the taxonomic names (TAXPATH_SN) for all taxa that lie on
this path are included. We are not parsing this column for the competition but
will use the distributed NCBI reference taxonomy version. Please ensure that
your predictions comply with this version. Taxonomic identifers in the TAXPATH
and TAXPATH_SV for different taxonomic ranks are separated by "|". If a TAXID
is missing at a rank or there is no name, this can be marked with an empty
entry in the TAXPATH and TAXPATH_SN "||". For partial paths from the root to an
internal node, you only need to fill in the path until you reach the node.

    # Example for TAXPATH_SN:
    Archaea|Thaumarchaeota|||Aigarchaeota archaeon JGI 0000001-A7

    # Example for:
    TAXPATH 2157|651137 |651142 |1104572 |1052838

Further fields with additional information can be appended to the right. Each
output line should match:

    /^([A-Za-z0-9\|\_\s]\t)+([0-9]{0,3}\.[0-9]+)/
